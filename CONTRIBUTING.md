## How to get Involved

Everyone is welcomed to contribute to our projects, no matter how experienced you are. [DeckDeckGo] was an important learning experience for ourselves and, we would be happy if contributing to our project is also profitable to you in terms of learning.

## Technical facts

[DeckDeckGo] is a mix of applications, components, functions and infrastructure. You could have a look to our [README](README.md) which lists all of these.

In short summary, all our applications and components are developed with [Stencil.JS](https://stenciljs.com) Web Components.

Our website is implemented with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

On the other side, our publication engine is developed with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

## Issues

We are flagging our [issues](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/issues) with the labels `good first issue` when we think that the issue is accessible without too much experience and know-how of our project. We are also flagging issue with the label `question` when we need your input. It could be general questions such as brainstorming regarding UX or anything else.

You are welcomed to find these kinds of issues to get started but obviously if you don't find any issue, don't hesitate to take over other types of issues if they inspire you.

In any case, ping us to get start, your help would be super appreciated!

## Bugs and features requests

Some bugs (sh\*t happens) might not yet been reported. Likewise, your awesome ideas to make [DeckDeckGo] better are always wanted. Therefore don't hesitate to open new [issues](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/issues) but if you are unsure about if it's the right place or if you would like to discuss it first, go to [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/deckdeckgo/shared_invite/enQtNzM0NjMwOTc3NTI0LTBlNmFhODNhYmRkMWUxZmU4ZTQ2MDJiNjlmYWZiODNjMDU5OGRjYThlZmZjMTc5YmQ3MzUzMDlhMzk0ZDgzMDY) for that purpose.

## Translation

We are in the making of adding i18n to our applications. These following are those which can be currently translated.

We would be grateful to get your help to translate our apps!

### Site

The new website of [DeckDeckGo] supports i18n. To provide a new language with a Pull Request, follow these steps:

1. Copy each [pages](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/tree/master/site/src/pages/) to their new languages. For example `index.en.js` to `index.fr.js` to create a French page.
2. Translate the text of the pages "index, enterprise and discover" in their related [json](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/tree/master/site/src/assets/i18n/) data.
3. Translate all other pages directly in their related Javascript files (we did not extract the text from the "simple" page).
4. Provide a translation for the [meta](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/blob/master/site/gatsby-config.js) description.
